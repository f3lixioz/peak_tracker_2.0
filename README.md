This app lists out all the 14'ers in Colorado and helps you keep track of when you completed the summit. The original idea was to prepopulate a list of 14'ers which once you check off, it will automatically move the entry from a "to do" list into a "completed" list. The intention was to allow one single edit button to alter all fields. However, the issue lay in my inability to figure out how to edit multiple properties from a single state (as noted in the NewPeak.js file). Another issue I ran into was using the patch command to replace only the field given. As such, I was only able to update one field.
